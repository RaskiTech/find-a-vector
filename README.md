# Find a vector

Find a vector is a vector visualizer, as well as a vector finder. If you want to know a vector that you know some points to, or you just want to play with vectors, find a vector is for you. You can visualize vectors being calculated and calculate the best fit curve.


# How to use it
Put some points on the plain by clicking on the spots you want the points. These are you data points that you'll fit your line into. Once you have placed the points, select a vector you want to use from the "Select a vector" dropdown.
If you want to visualize the vector being calculated, click the visualize the vector bunnot. If you just want to know the answer, click the Calculate the vector button.
You can control how fast the calculating is being done with the speed slider.

Note:
- Higher polynomials are slower to visualize
- The farther the points are from the origin, the more time it takes to visualize
- These don't apply to calculating
